# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

Our tech meetup is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

## Expected behavior

- **Respectful communication:** Treat all attendees, speakers, sponsors, and organizers with respect and consideration. Use welcoming and inclusive language, and be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.

- **Privacy:** Respect the privacy of attendees. Do not share personal information without consent.

- **Professional conduct:** Behave professionally at all times. Alert meetup organizers if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.

- **Participate authentically:** Share insights, ask questions, and engage with the content and other participants constructively.


## Unacceptable behavior

- **Harassment and discrimination:** Harassment of any kind, including but not limited to verbal, physical, or sexual harassment as well as discriminatory comments, jokes, or actions.

- **Disruptive behavior:** Disruptions of presentations or other events, including excessive noise, physical interference, or other distractions.

- **Intimidation and threats:** Intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the meetup, or reporting to local law enforcement.


## Reporting

If you are subjected to unacceptable behavior, notice that someone else is being subjected to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify an event organizer as soon as possible. Organizers will be available to assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup.
